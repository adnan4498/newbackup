By default we have display block in our div element. (some elements dont have dispaly block as default you can search over google)

so display block says that it does not want any other element with its left or right side .. any other element
will be under that div element bcz of display block.

if we have 2 div's they will be up and down to each other but, if we change there display property to


display: inline;


then they will come by left and right side to each other. but there are some restrictions to display inline property.

with display inline you cannot set widht height or left right padding and margin. 

with display inline the div will be fixed with its element inside.

like we have lorem20, 20 text words so our div container or border anything, will be fixed to our text inside, fixed size width height
 


so the conclusion is 

display block = elements (div's) up and down to each other
display inline = elements (div's) right and left to each other easily ( but no width height or left right padding nor margin) and fix size to element



Important Note = after getting your div to right side of the first div. now you might be wanting to increase its 
		 height and width, for that we have a display proeprty called 

						inline-block

		with inline-block property we can set div to right side and we can change its width height padding maring etc anything !
