To use google fonts in your css


first we select a font in google fonts

for example we select Roboto font

then inside Roboto font go down to   Styles

then there will be multiple varients of fonts for Roboto font . .select anyone

how to select ? at every varient of font there will be a + sign with bold or thin or italic anything will be written on that

after clicking on that + sign then at top left corner there will be an icon of view selected families

after clicking view selected families. below will be option of    <link> 

select link and then copy the link and paste that link right up on your <title> tag in css

after that go to selected families and below <link> there will be   CSS rules to specify families and it will have that font you wanted like:


font-family : Roboto, 'Sans Serif', 'Qwitcher Grypen';


copy the above font-family and paste it in your css where you want to use this font.


so basically we get a link from google fonts and get that font property and then paste both stuff in Css.
