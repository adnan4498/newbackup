if we have 2 div's 

one has margin 3 and lower div has margin 6 (margin top and bottom)


you might think both div space will be margin 9px .. bcz of 6+3=9 right ? NOOO

bcz the div with the largest margin will be considered in the browser. 

you can see in the image or margin collapse in css notes. 

upper div has margin 3px
lower div has margin 7px 


the space between both div's is margin 7px. bcz when the browser gives the margin 7px
upper already got its 3px margin in that 7px margin.

weather a div is upper or lower. the div or any element with greater margin will be 
given priority by the browser .. default !
