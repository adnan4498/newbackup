The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

if you see at the imaeg of (box sizing front end) you will see 2 div's up and down
if we want to know the box sizing of the lower blue colour div.

and we look at its inspect and go to layout and we see a box sizing.

so here we can calculate the box sizing of the blue div.


.div{
    background-color: aqua;
    margin: 20px;
    height: 20px;
    padding: 2px;
    border: 1px solid black;
}


look at the box model in inspect layout.


first we got element
than padding
than border
than margin 

element size is 20px (in widht and height)
then we have 2px padding (top and bottom padding 2+2)
then we have 1px border (top and bottom 1+1)
then we have 20px margin (top and bottom 20+20)

the total affective height will be 66pixel.



so
