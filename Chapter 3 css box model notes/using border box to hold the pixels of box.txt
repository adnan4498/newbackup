When we use border box property for box sizing.

the size of box does not increase chahe jitni bi padding do.

if we have a div of 

width 100px;
border 10px;
padding 50px;

the size wont be 100px, it will be increased to 240 bcz of all round border and 50 + 50 padding.

to stop the size getting increased from 100px to 240px

we use border box property 


it will adjust and it wont increase the widht anymore instead it will increase height but the total
size will remain 100px not 240px.

if you give width 100 with padding 10 and border 5 in content box... the padding
and border will not be included in the 100px widht, thus 100px width will be getting
extra size bcz of padding and border.. result in leak or bigger box etc

if you give width 100 with padding 10 and border 5 in border box... the padding
and border will be included in the 100px width. everything will  be inside
of widht.margin is not included in border box.
