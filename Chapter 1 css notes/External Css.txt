For external css first we have to make a file name 	style.css

then we have to give its link inside our index.html file. right under 

		<title> Document </title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

so our style.css file css will be added to our index.html


any html file you make with that make a css file and give css file link into html file.

you can make 2 html files and you can add both css into same style.css file but for that give style.css link
in both html files.
