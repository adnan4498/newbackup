Block-level Elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.




Inline Elements	

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.



IMPORTANT Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!



inline element tags can contain mutliple inline element tags in it. like span can contain multiple inline tags.

block element tags cannot contain multiple block element tags in it. like <div> will create new space and will take all the widht.


Note = block element tag takes full widht takes the whole line by default, but we can set its widht by accessing its css. in inspect.
