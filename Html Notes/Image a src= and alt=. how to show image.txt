		  This is the image link we copied from google and pasted in the
		  anchor image tag. it will show the image on frontend



		  alt=""     alt is used for a text message to be show if the image
			     was not loaded due to an error 
		 
		  for example =    alt="Image not loaded"
				   alt="Image error"		etc 	



absoloute and reletive links works in <a img=""	

for example we save a image as image.jpg in our project (in django save it in static file / folder)	
then we can load the image by 

	<a img="image.jpg" alt=""> = image will be loaded


	
Note =  In django you might have to write code with load static 

make a folder name static .. save image in static folder.. suppose that image name is image.jpg

{% load static %}

<img src="{static 'image.jpg'}" />   	=  image will be loaded
