Header will be the heading. it contains nav bar.

main will have the content of the website.. with section aricle aside etc

<main>
	<section> A page section
	<article> A self combined content
	<aside> content aside from the content (eg Ads etc)
</main>

footer will be at last 




we can type all this in <h1> tag or <p> tag but it wont be user friendly
chrome robot wont detect what contect to show over web for better traffic.
so use everything properly and wisely.   




Follow this layout so your page will be SEO friendly, user experince will be good
